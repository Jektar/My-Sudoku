# My-Sudoku
A pygame application I make that generates sudokus and let's you play the game.

A simple 9x9 sudoku program that I made in python.
As graphics are made with pygame, you will have to have the pygame library installed in the python enviroment you are running this in.

To play, hover over empty slots and press a number. This earmarks it. If you want to commit it, click on it or press space while hovering over it.
You can remove earmarks by overiding them with other number, or removing it by entering 0. Only if you commit it, it will either fill if correct
or add one mistake if wrong.
